# Shoppers-Data-Analysis


This repository contains the code and analysis for the Online Shoppers Intention dataset. The dataset consists of information on online shoppers' behavior, including their session duration, bounce rate, and product-related information. The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset and explore different clustering and classification techniques to gain insights into online shopping behavior.

### Data

The dataset used in this project is the Online Shoppers Intention dataset, which can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 12,330 sessions with 18 different features, including 10 numerical and 8 categorical features.

### Analysis
The analysis in this project includes several steps:

Data exploration and visualization: Histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are used to explore the distribution of the features and the relationship between different features.

Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed by dropping irrelevant columns, encoding categorical variables, and applying PCA for visualization.

Clustering: KMeans and DBSCAN clustering algorithms are applied to the dataset, and their performance is evaluated using silhouette score.

Classification: Naive Bayes, KNN, and Decision Tree classifiers are trained on the dataset, and their performance is evaluated using cross-validation and accuracy score.

### Conclusion

The analysis in this project provides insights into online shopping behavior and demonstrates the use of different clustering and classification techniques. The results suggest that KMeans clustering and KNN classification algorithms perform well on the dataset. However, more advanced techniques and feature engineering may be necessary to achieve better performance.
